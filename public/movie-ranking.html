<h1>The Best Movies According to Sixto</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Heat</h3>


<p>Now, what can be better than a movie including Robert De Niro Vs. Al Pacino right?. So Heat
    is the perfect movie to watch pretty much anytime, everywhere... a lot of action, tough guys
    against each other, and two brilliant minds against each other. The movie is more than 3 hours i think,
    and you never wanna get out of the TV.</p>

<h3>Collateral</h3>

<p>Collateral is a great movie with a great story, a lot of violence, good actors and
    is always driving you into suspense!</p>

<h3>Point Break</h3>

<p>Point Break is a hell of a movie because i love surfing!, great actors, and a super
    hilarious story!</p>
